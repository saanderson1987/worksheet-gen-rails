# Worksheet Generator
[View a sample](https://saanderson1987.github.io/worksheet-generator-sample/) of the work in progress!

Worksheet Generator is a tool to create digital educational worksheets. Teachers can create digital worksheets for their students to complete. Also, students will be able to create their own worksheets to help them study. Currently, the application supports fill-in-blank worksheets, and in the future it will support other types of worksheets such as matching, multiple-choice, etc.

The application is built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL on the backend, and React and Redux on the front end.

My most notable feature is the ability for users to edit worksheets by using a drag and drop interface. I have leveraged Dan Abramov's ReactDnD library for this. You can witness a sample of this [here](https://saanderson1987.github.io/worksheet-generator-sample/). 

Access to the full application is almost ready!
